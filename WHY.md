## WHY

Coming from Pakistan, there's the culture of "jugarh" or "to improvise". People from the sub-continent will know exactly what I'm talking about.

 In the age of AI, this has gotten even worse - being able to copy-paste answers without even thinking what's happening is one of the core issues my culture is facing. This is BAD in the long run.  

 The only solution is to ask - **WHY**? 

 I see students cheating on interviews by pulling up ChatGPT on the side. When a question is asked, they wait for a bit to type the question in and then rattle off what ChatGPT said. **Hold on, think about that! You are now a slave to the machine, quite literally!** You just proved that the AI should take your job. "Jugardh" only made you a slave to machines! 

 So what's the answer? Well simple, there's no one answer, there's only a question. Ask WHY? - not in the interview but before and you'll get somewhere. You'll get curious to know what the answer is and you won't have to rely on any AI to spoon-feed you at interviews or thereafter.
